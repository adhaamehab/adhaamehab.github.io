I'm a Software Engineer in Cairo 🇪🇬. I like Distributed Systems ☸️, Cloud ☁️ and Data Processing.

Previoulsy, I worked for [Statsbomb](statsbomb.com), Floralytics, other companies.

Rarely, I blog. And I always keep [my reading list](https://github.com/adhaamehab/my-reading-list) Up-to-date. 

I did some minor contributions to intersting open source projects. Like [Okteto](https://github.com/okteto/okteto), [OSQuery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery) and more, But now I'm focused on making [Apache Beam's](https://beam.apache.org/) Go SDK ready for production.

I'm also a M.Sc. student Majored in Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing and Information Science at Ainshams University where I got my BSc in Computer Science.

Here's my [resume](https://adhaamehab.dev/resume.pdf)
