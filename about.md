I'm a Software Engineer in Cairo 🇪🇬. I like Distributed Systems ☸️, Cloud ☁️ and Data Processing.

Previoulsy, I worked for [Statsbomb](statsbomb.com), Floralytics and other companies.

Sometimes, I blog. And I always keep [my reading list](https://github.com/adhaamehab/my-reading-list) Up-to-date. 

I did some contributions to intersting open source projects.

I'm also a M.Sc. student Majored in Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing and Information Science at Ainshams University where I got my BSc in Computer Science.

Here's my [resume](https://adhaamehab.dev/resume.pdf)
