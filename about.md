I'm a Software Engineer in Cairo ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¬. I like Distributed Systems, Cloud and Data Processing.

Previoulsy, I worked for [Statsbomb](statsbomb.com), Floralytics, other companies.

Rarely, I blog. And I always keep [my reading list](https://github.com/adhaamehab/my-reading-list) Up-to-date. 

I did some minor contributions to intersting open source projects. And I've started to focus on making [Beam's](https://beam.apache.org/) Go SDK ready for production.

I'm also a M.Sc. student Majored in Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing and Information Science at Ainshams University from where I got my BSc in Computer Science.

Here's my [resume](https://adhaamehab.dev/resume.pdf)
