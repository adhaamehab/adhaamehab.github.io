Hi,
I'm a Senior Software Engineer living in Cairo and work at [Statsbomb](statsbomb.com)([Arqam](arqamfc.com/#team)/)

I learn from open source and I try to payback by doing small contributions.

I blog & read about tech stauff and get excited to discuss them with others. 

Previously I worked for Floralytics, ABM Egypt, Tajjer in different roles between Full Stack developer and Data Scientist. 

I have a BSc in computer scince specialized in scientific & high performance computing from Ainshams university.
